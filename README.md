# VisualProspecting
### by SinTh0r4s

This mod is purely for player convenience. It tracks all found GT Ore Veins and visualizes them integrated on a JourneyMap overlay.

It tracks all ores that a player interacted with. Wether by right or left click. It also integrates prospecting data from _GT Advanced Prospector_.

It also adds a craftable _Prospectors Log_ that allows to share all prospected GT Ore Veins of a player to be shared/synchronized to whoever will read the book.

This mod is taylored to _GregTech: New Horizons 2_, but feel free to use it however you like. The power of MIT is yours ;)
